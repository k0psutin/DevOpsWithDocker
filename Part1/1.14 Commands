# I had to delete credentials.yml.enc from /config and re-create credentials with:
k0psutin@k0psutin:~/Documents/DevOps/practice/rails$ sudo docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/app -e EDITOR=vim rails bin/rails credentials:edit 
New credentials encrypted and saved.

# And then i had to start the server with the new secret key code:
k0psutin@k0psutin:~/Documents/DevOps/practice/rails$ sudo docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -e SECRET_KEY_BASE=4529284730ecf6e5b85c54be3fd10029 rails
